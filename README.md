The MLH Events Dashboard is a web application that displays all upcoming MLH (Major League Hacking) events from the MLH website and a Google Sheet acting as a database. The dashboard is designed using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI, providing a responsive and visually appealing user interface. The backend functionality is implemented using Google Apps Script (AppScript), which fetches data from the MLH API and populates the Google Sheet with event information

DaisyUI: An extension for Tailwind CSS that provides ready-to-use components for a quick and visually appealing UI.
Google Apps Script: Provides server-side scripting capabilities to interact with Google services.
MLH API: Integration with the MLH API to fetch live event data.
Google Sheets: Utilized as a dynamic data source to store and manage event information.

Configuration
